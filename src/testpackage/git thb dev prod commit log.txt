removed the comments of payment
		added the comments for the atomic codes of payment that have been removed 
		fixed codes where search of books was working only for first topic after instant book search 
			made this work multi topic
		fixed the same above for opposite log in/out scenario

while committing simply pasted webapp ui files into eclipse , took eclipse src code and pushed
it's wrong 
as next task it's important to take back of tomcat existing webapp
build again from eclipse and check in tomcat for same functionalities
also from next time atleast the changes should be in git diff command line for git log .
