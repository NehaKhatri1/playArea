 ****************************** 17th August ****************************************************
 
 I strongly recommed to work at home on startup exactly like you used to work in office . one to two food breaks , some casual breaks 
 and apart from that work as if like previous boss from your company is sitting by your side . If you are so passionate aobut startup , 
 work more at this office even after designated office hours .
 
 I am starting my routinue in away that i could follow your advice.Yes thats true if we can do work in other companies around 9-12 hours 
 then we should also try to work more harder in our startup.From today onwards i m going to work in startup mode.
