Design that has been already done

1. registration page --ready
2. locality dropdown with suggestions ( town/city and state ) --ready 
3. subjects lists :- done

To be done :-
4. skip button  :-functionality is not ready as i m working on one mejor issue 
             in which user's home page gets loaded everytime after locality selection .
             It looks like event or event.preventDefault is not working properly.

5. matching on the basis of geograpics & subjects :- not done (ll take up after point 4)
6.edit profile section  :- not done 
7. if some one hasn't entered any data , suggest them trending teachers and students :- not done
